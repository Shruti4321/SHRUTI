I want to get cpu information of my server through the following command:
$ internsctl cpu getinfo

#!/bin/bash

if [ "$1" == "cpu" ] && [ "$2" == "getinfo" ]; then
    lscpu
else
    echo "Usage: $0 cpu getinfo"
fi

I want to get memory information of my server through the following command:
$ internsctl memory getinfo

#!/bin/bash

if [ "$1" == "memory" ] && [ "$2" == "getinfo" ]; then
    free
else
    echo "Usage: $0 memory getinfo"
fi
